 Given a sequence of click events performed by some user during a typical session in an e-commerce website, the goal is to predict whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy. The task could therefore be divided into two sub goals: 1. Is the user going to buy items in this session? Yes|No 2. If yes, what are the items that are going to be bought?
